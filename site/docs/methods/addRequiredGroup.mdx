# addRequiredGroup

Makes the new fields group required. It could be a group of checkboxes or radio buttons.
It means that at least one input in the group should be checked/selected.

The method return a JustValidate instance, so it could be used as a chain (like `.addRequiredGroup().addRequiredGroup()...`).

The method takes 3 arguments:

```js
addRequiredGroup(groupField, errorMessage, config);
```

where:

`groupField` - a string selector or DOM element of the fields group

`errorMessage` - a custom error message

`config` - some specific settings applied to this particular group (the same as described [here](/docs/methods/addField)).

### Example

```js
const validation = new JustValidate('#form');

validation.addRequiredGroup('#radio-group', 'Select at lease one option!', {
  successMessage: 'Everything looks good',
});
```
