# onValidate

Callback triggered after every validation run.

:::info

If you use this callback before submitting the form, in some cases `isValid` could be `undefined` as we don't run the whole form validation before submit.
If you need to use `isValid` state before submitting you should use `validateBeforeSubmitting` config prop ([docs](/docs/instance/validateBeforeSubmitting)).

:::

```js
.onValidate({
    isValid,
    isSubmitted,
    fields,
    groups,
})
```
